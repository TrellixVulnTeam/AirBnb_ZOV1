## about this project
* What was the most challenging part of this project?
  * quickly get familirize the how to use new syntax on sequelize database,association, query method, and data manipution to get the desire results.  
* What part of your work on the project are you most proud of?
  * the booking feature makes sure that users can make arrangement in the future time period. Also check to make sure no deplication is booked if overlapping. 
  *breaking things down and debugging/probloem soving. Frequent testing and coding to make sure things work, isolating the issues, so it's easier to debug. 
* What are some parts you would like to go back and improve and/or minor bugs you would like to clean up?
  * I would spend more time on planing out some of the common middlewares that can be resued multiple time and make the codes more clean and dry.
